# SimpleTimer 
I just wanted to do something while outside of school, and since im quite new to coding, I decided to code a simple Timer with a tkinter
gui using a lot of help from ChatGPT. 

- 13.09.2023 - Timer function works, GUI needs some more work, No sound 
- 14.09.2023 - Fixed GUI compatibility with Timer script, removed TimerScript.py after intergrating most of it in GUI.py. I'm aware that Secondsscript.py can be easily replaced by Minutesscript.py, but don't change a working program as they say :)

- INFOUPDATE 11.18.2025 - I decided to keep this repo public, as it is one of my first ever projects. The code is very scrappy, everything is very messy, but everyone starts somewhere, right ;)
